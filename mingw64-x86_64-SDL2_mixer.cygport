# The included libtool macros have been hacked for the *-*-mingw* target to
# produce SDL2_mixer.dll (instead of the usual libSDL2_mixer-2-0-0.dll) and to
# set deplibs_check_method=pass_all (to allow linking with -ldxguid, which is
# static).  Therefore, we must use these macros and the corresponding ltmain.sh.
